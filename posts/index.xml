Here I shall mention a few I have found useful.
cargo-watch &amp;ndash; checks for changes in source then runs a command when there is one. e.g., cargo watch -x run. cargo-checkmate &amp;ndash; runs a whole bunch of pretty sane checks on your code. a great pre-submit (it can even install itself). cargo-udeps &amp;ndash; finds unused dependencies as in catch +nightly udeps cargo-deny &amp;ndash; a bit like cargo-audit that cargo-checkmate pulls in, but does licenses, allows stuff to be banned and configured, check where crates come from.</description></item><item><title>Wireguard on OpenBSD 6.8 to 7.1</title><link>/2020/10/wireguard-on-openbsd-6.8-to-7.1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 23:18:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>/2020/10/wireguard-on-openbsd-6.8-to-7.1/</guid><description>OpenBSD 6.8 includes WireGuard . WireGuard allows one to build VPNs. For a long time, OpenBSD has had excellent IPsec support. Unfortunately the same cannot be said of IPSec support on other platforms, and inevitably a VPN relies upon good software for all parties to VPN. WireGuard is pretty good on all platforms, making it very attractive. By pretty good, I mean: straightforward to use and well-engineered (fast, secure, code quality, crypto design, etc).</description></item><item><title>Sensible Development with a Raspberry Pi 3</title><link>/2020/05/sensible-development-with-a-raspberry-pi-3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2020 09:12:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>/2020/05/sensible-development-with-a-raspberry-pi-3/</guid><description>The Raspberry Pi 3 is surprisingly powerful. Here&amp;rsquo;s what mine does:
File serving using Samba. Git repository hosting using gitea. Continuous testing and building using Drone. Encrypted backups of itself and other hosts using duplicity Monitoring of my network: I dump various stats to rrd then plot via a small Go web renderer. Raspberry Pi 3 has two weaknesses for this set up: storage and 100Mbps network.
My Raspberry Pi 3 only uses its SD card to boot; all storage is on a separate NAS.</description></item><item><title>Dead Simple Linux Sandboxes</title><link>/2020/03/dead-simple-linux-sandboxes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Mar 2020 22:06:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/03/dead-simple-linux-sandboxes/</guid><description>bubblewrap is a wonderful tool for creating sandboxes as an unprivileged user.

It is a thin wrapper around common tools: gnupgfor cryptography, tar(1) for archiving, and rsyncfor file synchronisation. These are very widely used and widely available programs. They work on almost any platform. And these programs (plus your encryption key) are all you need to get to your back up if duplicity is not available. duplicity just makes it easier to create, verify, maintain and extract back ups.</description></item><item><title>SQL for CSV files</title><link>/2020/01/sql-for-csv-files/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2020 19:35:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/01/sql-for-csv-files/</guid><description>sqlite can be used to provide an SQL interface to CSV files. sqlite provides several ways to interact with CSV files. CSV virtual tables is a separate loadable library that provides efficient read-only access to CSV files. At the time of writing, however, the library is compiled separately from sqlite itself, making it a little cumbersome to use. Fortunately, sqlite has a very straightforward built-in way to interact with CSV files: .</description></item><item><title>Build a new Linux Kernel under Debian</title><link>/2019/04/build-a-new-linux-kernel-under-debian/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2019 19:21:09 +0100</pubDate><guid>/2019/04/build-a-new-linux-kernel-under-debian/</guid><description>This page describes how to build your own Linux kernel under Debian . It is often useful to build your own kernel as sometimes the Debian default lacks something you need (for example, I need to enable RMI4 on my Thinkpad X1C6) or includes bloat you do not want (e.g., uncommon protocols such as RDS that might leave you exposed to an undisclosed or future vulnerability unecessarily.

Unlike most daemons, irssi runs as a normal user and so the privileges of irssi are just those of the invoking user. By sandboxing irssi, it is restricted beyond those privileges of the invoking user. For example, irssi is able to read /etc/passwd and also run other programs.
This page describes how to sandbox irssi under OpenBSD using its builtin sandboxing mechanisms pledge(2) and unveil(2) . Each restricts the capabilities of a process in different ways.</description></item><item><title>OpenBSD Hardening Tricks</title><link>/2018/11/openbsd-hardening-tricks/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Nov 2018 07:21:46 +0100</pubDate><guid>/2018/11/openbsd-hardening-tricks/</guid><description>OpenBSD is locked down by default. Here are a few extra steps that can be taken.
Harden malloc OpenBSD &amp;rsquo;s malloc(3) performs many checks by default. Further checks can be enabled as follows:
# Under OpenBSD 6.4 or earlier $ doas ln -s CFGU /etc/malloc.conf # Under OpenBSD 6.5 or later $ doas sysctl -w vm.malloc_conf=CFGU Accounting Accounting provides a log of all commands run, via lastcomm(1) and summarise via sa(8) .</description></item><item><title>GPG/PGP Email Forwarding</title><link>/2018/07/gpg/pgp-email-forwarding/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jul 2018 13:39:29 +0100</pubDate><guid>/2018/07/gpg/pgp-email-forwarding/</guid><description>This page describes how to GPG encrypt and then forward all incoming mail. It should work with any modern UNIX that supports .forward. In particular, this page describes how to GPG encrypt and forward to user@example.org using an already generated GPG key.
