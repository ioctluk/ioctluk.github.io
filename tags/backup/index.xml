It is a thin wrapper around common tools: gnupgfor cryptography, tar(1) for archiving, and rsyncfor file synchronisation. These are very widely used and widely available programs. They work on almost any platform. And these programs (plus your encryption key) are all you need to get to your back up if duplicity is not available. duplicity just makes it easier to create, verify, maintain and extract back ups.</description></item></channel></rss>
