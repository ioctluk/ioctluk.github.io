WireGuard allows one to build VPNs. For a long time, OpenBSD has had excellent IPsec support. Unfortunately the same cannot be said of IPSec support on other platforms, and inevitably a VPN relies upon good software for all parties to VPN. WireGuard is pretty good on all platforms, making it very attractive. By pretty good, I mean: straightforward to use and well-engineered (fast, secure, code quality, crypto design, etc).</description></item><item><title>Sandboxing irssi</title><link>/2019/03/sandboxing-irssi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2019 07:07:43 +0100</pubDate><guid>/2019/03/sandboxing-irssi/</guid><description>irssiis an IRC client. Unlike most daemons, irssi runs as a normal user and so the privileges of irssi are just those of the invoking user. By sandboxing irssi, it is restricted beyond those privileges of the invoking user. For example, irssi is able to read /etc/passwd and also run other programs.
This page describes how to sandbox irssi under OpenBSD using its builtin sandboxing mechanisms pledge(2) and unveil(2) . Each restricts the capabilities of a process in different ways.</description></item><item><title>OpenBSD Hardening Tricks</title><link>/2018/11/openbsd-hardening-tricks/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Nov 2018 07:21:46 +0100</pubDate><guid>/2018/11/openbsd-hardening-tricks/</guid><description>OpenBSD is locked down by default. Here are a few extra steps that can be taken.
Harden malloc OpenBSD &amp;rsquo;s malloc(3) performs many checks by default. Further checks can be enabled as follows:
# Under OpenBSD 6.4 or earlier $ doas ln -s CFGU /etc/malloc.conf # Under OpenBSD 6.5 or later $ doas sysctl -w vm.malloc_conf=CFGU Accounting Accounting provides a log of all commands run, via lastcomm(1) and summarise via sa(8) .</description></item></channel></rss>
