Here I shall mention a few I have found useful.
cargo-watch &amp;ndash; checks for changes in source then runs a command when there is one. e.g., cargo watch -x run. cargo-checkmate &amp;ndash; runs a whole bunch of pretty sane checks on your code. a great pre-submit (it can even install itself). cargo-udeps &amp;ndash; finds unused dependencies as in catch +nightly udeps cargo-deny &amp;ndash; a bit like cargo-audit that cargo-checkmate pulls in, but does licenses, allows stuff to be banned and configured, check where crates come from.</description></item></channel></rss>
